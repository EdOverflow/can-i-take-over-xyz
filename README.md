Claim the subdomain discreetly and serve a harmless file on a hidden page. Do not serve content on the index page. A good proof of concept could consist of an HTML comment served via a random path:

```
$ cat aelfjj1or81uegj9ea8z31zro.html
<!-- PoC by username -->
```

Cargo Collective
=============

**Answer:** Yes :heavy_check_mark:

Help Juice
=========

**Answer:** Yes :heavy_check_mark:

GitHub
=======

**Answer:** Yes :heavy_check_mark: 

Look for a 404 page and either an A record pointing to `192.30.252.153` or `192.30.252.154`, or a CNAME record for `username.github.io`. The latter requires owning the GitHub handle so navigate to github.com/username to make sure that the username has not already been registered.

Gitlab
=====

**Answer:** No :negative_squared_cross_mark: 

GitLab require a text record with a verification token in order to set the custom domain. This was fixed as a result of <https://hackerone.com/reports/312118>.

AWS/S3
=======

**Answer:** Yes :heavy_check_mark: 

If a domain has a CNAME record for `*.s3.amazonaws.com` and is returning `NoSuchBucket`, then all you need to do is to create a bucket with that name. You will need an AWS account, however, you can use the [free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) which is more than enough for a PoC. You can then upload a simple txt file at a random path as a proof of concept. 

Cloudfront
========

**Answer:** Yes :heavy_check_mark:

When it comes to Cloudfront subdomain takeovers always check both ports 80 and 443. The error message "Bad Request" must be displayed on both ports to ensure that one can claim it on AWS.

If you find a domain that displays this error message, try adding that domain as CNAME to your CloudFront instance on http://aws.amazon.com/ .

**Answer:** No :negative_squared_cross_mark: 

In Fastly, you can only takeover subdomains if you can prove ownership of the domain name. For example, if `something.example.com` is not claimed on Fastly, you would only be able to claim it in your account if you can prove ownership of the parent domain, `example.com`, in this case.

Heroku
======

**Answer:** Yes :heavy_check_mark: 

Check the CNAME record. If it's pointing at `*.herokuapp.com`, and is returning "No such app", then all you need to do is to create a new app on Heroku with that name.
